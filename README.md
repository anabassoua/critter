## ðŸ¦‰ About my Project

I built a Twitter clone using React for the frontend, making it look great with Styled Components. We used React features like Router, State, Effects, Fetch, Context, Navigation, and useParams to make it work smoothly. It feels just like using Twitter, but it's all done with React magic!

## Setup

You'll need two active terminals to be able to run this application properly.

### Frontend (Website)

1. Open the terminal.
2. Go to the client folder by typing `cd client`.
3. Install the dependencies with `yarn install`.
4. Start the frontend with `yarn start`.

### Backend (Server)

1. Open the terminal. (You can use a split terminal).
2. Go to the server folder by typing `cd server`.
3. Install the dependencies with `yarn install`.
4. Start the backend(server) with `yarn start`.
